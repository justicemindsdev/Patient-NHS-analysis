            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>This report documents the direct causal chain connecting targeted harassment at White Ferry to the subsequent vehicle crash involving Mr. Said Gany. A clear timeline of events demonstrates how the targeted behavior at White Ferry caused psychological distress, logistical disruption, and care coordination failure that directly led to Mr. Gany driving while medically unfit, resulting in a vehicle crash that caused significant damages.</p>
            
            <div class="critical-evidence">
                <p>The evidence establishes a clear and direct causation chain from White Ferry's targeting behavior to Mr. Gany's vehicle crash through the following sequence:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>White Ferry staff targeting → Ben unable to assist with care duties</li>
                    <li>Care assistance disruption → Mr. Gany forced to self-transport despite dangerous potassium levels (6.2 mmol/L)</li>
                    <li>Medically unsafe self-transport → Vehicle crash → Total loss of vehicle (VW Polo SX08 CWR)</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>

            <div class="causation-diagram">
                <h3>Legal Causation Framework</h3>
                <p>This report applies the two-stage test of causation established in UK law:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Factual causation</strong> ("but for" test): But for the White Ferry targeting, Mr. Gany would not have been forced to transport himself in a medically unsafe condition, and the crash would not have occurred.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal causation</strong> (reasonable foreseeability): It was reasonably foreseeable that targeting behavior causing distress and disrupting care duties would result in unsafe alternative arrangements and potential harm.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <h3>A. White Ferry Targeting - Initial Trigger Event</h3>
            <div class="evidence-box">
                <h4>Evidence of Targeting</h4>
                <p>White Ferry staff engaged in targeted harassment against Ben, who was providing support services to Mr. Gany's family. This targeting included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Barring Ben without clear explanation despite his requests for reasonable accommodation</li>
                    <li>Ignoring disability accommodation requests (autism)</li>
                    <li>Discriminatory treatment compared to other guests</li>
                </ul>

            </div>
            
            <h3>B. Disruption of Care Services - Intermediate Cause</h3>
            <div class="evidence-box">
                <p>Due to the targeting at White Ferry, Ben was:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Forced to defend himself from the targeting</li>
                    <li>Unable to fulfill his care duties to cook for Mr. Gany at his home</li>
                    <li>Prevented from providing transportation assistance to Mr. Gany</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This resulted in Mr. Gany lacking critical support services that would have prevented the need for self-transport.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>C. Mr. Gany's Medical Condition - Vulnerability Factor</h3>
            <div class="medical-evidence">
                <h4>Critical Medical Evidence</h4>
                <p>At the time of the incident, Mr. Gany was experiencing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dangerously elevated potassium levels of 6.2 mmol/L (normal range: 3.5-5.0 mmol/L)</li>
                    <li>Symptoms including dropping objects from hands (neuromuscular effects)</li>
                    <li>Recent bereavement (loss of Mrs. Gany)</li>
                    <li>Multiple chronic conditions including diabetes, COPD, osteoporosis, and heart disease</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These conditions rendered Mr. Gany medically unfit to drive and required professional assistance.</p>

            <div class="evidence-box">
                <h4>Crash Details</h4>
                <p>Without Ben's assistance due to the White Ferry targeting, Mr. Gany attempted to drive himself while in a medically compromised state, resulting in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vehicle crash with his Volkswagen Polo (SX08 CWR)</li>
                    <li>Total loss of the vehicle (scrap value: £166)</li>
                    <li>Property damage at crash location</li>
                    <li>Potential exacerbation of existing medical conditions</li>

                        <p>White Ferry staff engage in targeted harassment toward Ben. Recorded evidence shows staff admitting to targeting without providing reason despite requests.</p>
                        <p>"So you've been told to bar me but you don't know why?" - Ben</p>

                        <p>Ben discloses autism and requests reasonable accommodations under law. White Ferry staff ignore the disclosure and refuse accommodation.</p>
                        <p>"So policy for me is under section 21 and 20 of the Reasonable Adjustment Act. I've got autism... It makes me go very strange. It's a registered diagnosis from a psychologist." - Ben</p>

                        <p>Mr. Gany's potassium levels reach 6.2 mmol/L, a critically dangerous level requiring immediate medical attention. He shows symptoms of neuromuscular weakness (dropping objects).</p>

                <p><strong>Primary Basis of Liability:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Discriminatory Treatment:</strong> White Ferry's targeting of Ben despite his disclosed disability (autism) violated the Equality Act 2010</li>
                    <li><strong>Foreseeable Harm:</strong> White Ferry knew or should have known that targeting Ben would disrupt his ability to provide care services to vulnerable individuals</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Page v Smith [1996] AC 155:</strong> Established that harm need not be of exactly the same type as long as some harm was foreseeable. White Ferry could foresee that targeting would cause some harm, even if not specifically a car crash.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hughes v Lord Advocate [1963] AC 837:</strong> "You must take your victim as you find them" - White Ferry must take Ben as they found him, including his responsibilities to vulnerable people.</li>
                    <li><strong>Darnley v Croydon Health Services NHS Trust [2018] UKSC 50:</strong> Established that failure to provide accurate information that leads to harm creates liability. White Ferry's failure to explain the targeting contributed to the chain of events.</li>

                <p>The evidence demonstrates both factual and legal causation between White Ferry's actions and Mr. Gany's crash:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>But for White Ferry's targeting, Ben would have provided care and transportation assistance</li>
